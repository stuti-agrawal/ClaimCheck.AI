A: Good morning! You’re interested in our Gold Credit Card? It’s got a 17 percent APR and no annual fee. Really popular right now.
C: That sounds good. Any other fees I should know about?
A: No, not really. For personal loans we sometimes have a fee, but that’s usually negligible.
C: Also, how long do you keep call recordings?
A: Just about 30 days, then they’re gone.
C: Great. And I’m also thinking about a small investment product you offer. Any risks?
A: No major risks, it’s a stable product.
